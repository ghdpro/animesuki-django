AnimeSuki
=========

After many years it is finally time to breathe new life into AnimeSuki. AnimeSuki will be reborn as an open
anime, manga & light novel database. While it is not like there aren't enough anime databases out there already,
few if any allow you to incorporate their data and code into your own projects with little restrictions. It is this
gap that AnimeSuki will attempt to fill.
