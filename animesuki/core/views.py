    PermissionRequiredMixin modified to show error message to user.

    By default the PermissionRequiredMixin does not generate an error message, it just redirects to the login page.
    As that can be confusing, this simple mixin makes sure the "permission_denied_message" string is returned to the
    user via the messages framework and also sets a reasonable default value for it.
